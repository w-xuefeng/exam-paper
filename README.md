- **Structured Data**: A dedicated package (`@exam-paper/structure`) for defining the core data models of exam papers, questions, and answers.
- **Rich Content Editor**: A powerful exam paper editor built with Vue.js 3 and Vite.
- **Customizable Renderer**: A flexible renderer (`@exam-paper/renderer`) to display exam papers from the structured data.
