# Exam Paper Project

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh-CN.md)

This is a monorepo for building, rendering, and managing exam papers. It provides a complete solution from data structure definition to a rich text editor for creation and a renderer for display.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Monorepo Architecture**: Uses `pnpm` workspaces to manage dependencies and relationships between packages.
- **Structured Data**: A dedicated package (`@exam-paper/structure`) for defining the core data models of exam papers, questions, and answers.
- **Rich Content Editor**: A powerful exam paper editor built with Vue.js 3 and Vite.
- **Customizable Renderer**: A flexible renderer (`@exam-paper/renderer`) to display exam papers from the structured data.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with TypeScript, Vue.js, and Vite for a fast and reliable development experience.
